# COVID-19-Pandemic-Analysis
This open source code is an attempt to analyse, plot and better understand predict spread of COVID19.
The data used are collected from different sources, I have also added a google doc from BNO News of Netherlands that is updated every day with latest numbers.

These are governmental official numbers from different countries (spreadsheet includes source links), which are using different methods of data collection. However, the initial trends were accurate enough to predict general growth of infections.
